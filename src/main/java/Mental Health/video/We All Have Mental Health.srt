2
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:14,158
you can't tell how someone feels just by

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,890
looking at them or what they share

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,349
online to the outside world our lives

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,758
may look perfect even if in reality they

6
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:25,379
aren't I'm always worrying about doing

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,328
well at school and with the end-of-year

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,307
test coming up I'm not sure how much

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,468
longer I can cope my thoughts swarm

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,959
around my head sometimes keeping me up

11
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:37,280
all night some days it's just all too

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,169
much and I feel like I'm lost in space

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,238
when I did badly on one of my tests I

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,399
just about kept it together until I got

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,398
home then I broke down crying in front

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,530
of my mum she listened for a bit and

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,379
then she told me that just like physical

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,629
health we all have mental health it's

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,259
our feelings our thinking our emotions

20
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:00,267
and our moods she then said that feeling

21
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,189
down anger and stress is a normal part

22
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:04,859
of life just like it's normal to feel

23
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,049
happy confident and carefree sometimes

24
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,028
we all have positive and negative

25
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,218
emotions that come and go based on

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,469
what's happening around us these are

27
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,558
everyday feelings good mental health

28
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,819
means experiencing negative emotions

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,829
it's not always about being happy

30
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,599
mum can relate to the themes of stress

31
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:24,368
when mom suggested I take a break from

32
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,358
everything and do something I enjoy

33
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:30,308
actually took her advice so I made

34
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:33,489
myself a hot chocolates not good often

35
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:36,149
adieu then watched a film and you know

36
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:41,797
what afterwards I felt so much better

37
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:43,750
mom should take her own advice most of

38
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,199
us only ever shared the good things we

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,179
don't like to share how we really feel

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,438
every morning when I wake up negative

41
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,360
thoughts streamed through my head

42
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,838
getting out of bed and pretending I'm

43
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,809
okay

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,639
takes all the energy I have as the day

45
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,909
goes on the negative thoughts turn from

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,470
a stream into a river the water rushes

47
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,319
through my head so loudly it's hard to

48
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:07,207
concentrate in lessons and some days

49
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,569
it's so bad it feels like a waterfall

50
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:13,750
that trying to pull me over the edge

51
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:15,218
everything is so overwhelming I didn't

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,099
think my friends would understand if I

53
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,778
told them how down I was feeling but

54
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:22,659
when Sasha opened up to me about how

55
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,699
stress she was feeling I told her I

56
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,619
wasn't sure how to bring up how I've

57
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,559
been feeling so I started by saying that

58
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,789
I didn't feel like myself just her

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,649
listening made me feel like she

60
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,968
understood

61
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,369
she told me some things that have helped

62
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:39,767
her so I tried them too but it didn't

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,450
make much of a difference even when I

64
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,060
tried to be around my friends I felt

65
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,899
alone the things I used to enjoy weren't

66
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,010
fun anymore

67
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,140
I was really worried about Andre I'm not

68
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,568
sure what to do he was quiet and wasn't

69
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,597
hanging out with us like he used to so I

70
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,399
asked our head of year for some advice

71
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,868
he suggested I get Andre to speak to him

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,779
since his negative feelings weren't

73
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,818
going away I didn't want to speak to our

74
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,829
head of year but I also didn't want to

75
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:10,999
keep feeling so down so I went he said

76
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,979
that sometimes we have overwhelming

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,139
feelings that can be more intense than

78
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:17,387
our everyday feelings these feelings

79
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:21,530
hang around for a long time and changed

80
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:23,030
the way we feel think and behave they

81
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,289
can stop us doing what we want to in

82
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,818
life that's what I was going through he

83
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:31,999
also said that if were physically unwell

84
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:33,499
we let people know we asked for help it

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,810
should be no different with mental

86
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,729
health sometimes our overwhelming

87
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,279
feelings are brought on because of

88
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:43,280
things in our life sometimes they happen

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,440
for no reason at all after hearing this

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,530
I felt much less alone and it felt good

91
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,418
to talk scientists have found exercise

92
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,129
can help when you're feeling low so

93
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,109
ahead of year encouraged me to sign up

94
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:57,078
to the school football club which Sasha

95
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,389
was already in I still have days when

96
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,309
the river is there but now I'm beginning

97
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,799
to understand my mental health I'm

98
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,689
learning how to cope ahead every year

99
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,879
reminded me that my friends my family

100
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,828
teachers and lots of others at school

101
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,108
are there to help just as much as he is

102
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,479
I had no idea that people around me

103
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,190
could be so understanding and while it's

104
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,379
not always easy to talk about my mental

105
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,839
health the person I'm talking to you

106
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:22,398
might be able to help if you don't feel

107
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,249
like talking that's fine

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,309
you could try writing sports reading art

109
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,709
music playing with your pet whatever

110
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,930
makes you feel better

111
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:34,178
if you're the person someone talks to

112
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,220
when they're struggling just listen with

113
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,019
no pressure or judgments you don't have

114
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,970
to have the answer if you feel unsure

115
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:43,238
about anything you can speak to a

116
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,380
trusted adult talking about mental

117
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,650
health doesn't have to be difficult

118
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:54,019
after all is something we all have
